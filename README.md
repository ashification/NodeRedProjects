# NodeRedProjects
This repository serves as examples for code to be used in NodeRed projects.
For versioning and compatability please note this was all developed on and for v4.0.8, Raspberry Pi 5 running raspian OS unless otherwise stated


## Integrations
I am integrating the above code with a Mosquitto MQTT broker which is also hosted on my Raspberry Pi 5.<br/> 
The MQTT Broker routes mesages to and from my pico2W and pi5 all .<br/><br/> 

### Installers
The code for setting up the broker and nodered can be found in my [raspberry pi base installers script](https://github.com/ashification/RPISetup/blob/main/Installers/rpi_base_installer.sh) under the followng headings:
- "# Install Mosquitto MQTT Broker"
- "## Installing nodeRed"
<br/>


### Raspberry Pi Pico Projects
If youre interested in putting togeterh some of your own Pico projects you can find my examples in my [Pico Projects Repo](https://github.com/ashification/PicoProjects/tree/main)
